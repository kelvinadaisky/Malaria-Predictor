# Malaria_Outbreak

Malaria Prediction Application
This project is designed to predict the number of malaria cases in a given region based on various socio-economic and environmental factors. The application leverages machine learning to provide accurate predictions, which can assist in planning and resource allocation to combat malaria.

Project Overview
Malaria remains a significant public health issue in many parts of the world, particularly in Africa. Accurate predictions of malaria cases can help health organizations and governments allocate resources more effectively and plan interventions to reduce the incidence of the disease.

This application uses historical data and various features such as population demographics, GDP, weather data, and healthcare access quality to predict the number of malaria cases. The application is built using Python and several data processing and machine learning libraries.

Features
Data Integration: Combines data from multiple sources including population, GDP, weather, and healthcare access.
Machine Learning Model: Utilizes a machine learning model to predict malaria cases.
User Input: Allows users to input data and get predictions for specific regions and time periods.
Risk Assessment: Evaluates the risk level of malaria based on the predictions.
Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language used for development.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Scikit-learn: For building and training the machine learning model.
Joblib: For saving and loading the machine learning models and preprocessing pipelines.
AWS EC2: For deploying the application.
Git: For version control and collaboration.
Data Sources
World Bank: Provides socio-economic data such as GDP and population.
Weather API: Supplies weather data including temperature and precipitation.
Healthcare Access Quality Index: Used to assess the quality of healthcare in different regions.
Historical Malaria Data: Provides past data on malaria incidence and mortality.
How It Works
Data Collection: Gather data from various sources including World Bank, weather APIs, and historical malaria data.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values and scaling numerical features.
Feature Engineering: Create and transform features needed for the machine learning model.
Model Training: Train the machine learning model using the preprocessed data.
Prediction: Use the trained model to predict malaria cases based on new input data.
Risk Assessment: Evaluate the risk level of malaria based on the predictions.
Conclusion
This malaria prediction application aims to provide valuable insights and predictions to help in the fight against malaria. By leveraging machine learning and integrating multiple data sources, the application can offer accurate and timely predictions to aid in resource allocation and intervention planning.
